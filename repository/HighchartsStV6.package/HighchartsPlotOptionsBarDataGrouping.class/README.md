Data grouping is the concept of sampling the data values into larger
blocks in order to ease readability and increase performance of the
JavaScript charts. Highstock by default applies data grouping when
the points become closer than a certain pixel value, determined by
the groupPixelWidth option.
If data grouping is applied, the grouping information of grouped
points can be read from the Point.dataGroup.
